# Hi, I’m Tina ✨ aka BakaBunnii 🐰
I’m a writer, mom, and aspiring developer diving headfirst into AI, Python, and robotics.

🎯 **Current Goals:**
- Finish my Coding Academy precourse ✅
- Upload my first Python bot 💻
- Earn Python & AI certifications 📜
- Build cool, helpful automation tools 🛠️

🧠 **What I'm Learning:**
- Python basics (variables, loops, logic)
- Bots and simple automation
- Git & GitHub (right here!)
- Project structure and best practices

🌱 **Why I'm Doing This:**
Ever since I watched my first episode of *Star Trek*, I’ve been fascinated by technology, exploration, and solving problems with intelligence and heart. Now that tech is booming, I realized I could feed two birds with one cracker—follow my passion and help my family at the same time. Learning to code is my way of boldly going where I’ve always dreamed.


🔮 **Fun Fact:**
Science is magical to me. I've always been fascinated by the thought of how our modern day advances in technology would be seen as magic in older times.
Because of this, I'm passionate about finding the next jump that captivates the mind and heart and reignites that feeling in a world where we've grown accustomed to such things. Before modern technology, many things we take for granted would've been considered "witchcraft", "sorcery" or some other mystical equivelant. We are capable of so much as a species and I'm determined to bring out the utmost of that.
